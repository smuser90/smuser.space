# Building a Timber Retaining Wall


As a software engineer, I usually spend my days in front of a computer. However, I recently decided to step out of my comfort zone and take on a massive DIY project: building a DIY retaining wall with landscaping timbers. Here's how I did it.

Retaining walls are crucial in landscaping, especially for managing soil erosion and creating level areas in sloping grounds. I chose landscaping timbers for my DIY project because of their durability, aesthetic appeal, and relative ease of handling.


## Planning and Preparation


Proper planning is the backbone of any successful project, DIY or otherwise. For my retaining wall, which was 125 linear feet x 3 feet high, I first calculated the dimensions and layout. I marked the trench line with precision, ensuring it was straight and consistent. This step was crucial for setting a solid foundation for the wall.


## Excavation and Trenching


The excavation part was challenging yet rewarding. I hand-dug the trench using a pickaxe, which was a great workout! Safety was my top priority, so I followed best practices to avoid any mishaps. Achieving the correct depth and width for the trench was vital for the wall's stability.

## Installing the First Course


Laying the first course of timbers required patience and precision. I used a spirit level and wooden stakes to ensure everything was perfectly aligned. Securing the timbers together was critical, so I opted for rebar and landscape spikes, which provided excellent stability.

## Building Subsequent Courses


Building additional courses was a test of consistency and accuracy. Staggering the joints between timbers was essential for added stability. Each course needed to be level and aligned to ensure a straight and sturdy wall.

## Backfilling and Compacting


Backfilling the trench was an easier task, thanks to a walk-behind dingo loader. Compacting the backfill material at each timber course was crucial for preventing future settlement. Proper drainage was also a key consideration to prevent soil erosion behind the wall.

## Finishing Touches and Maintenance


For the finishing touches, I considered staining the timbers and adding some decorative elements. Regular maintenance, like inspecting for any signs of damage, is something I plan to keep on top of to ensure the longevity of the wall.


## Conclusion


Building a DIY retaining wall with landscaping timbers was a challenging yet fulfilling experience. It taught me a lot about planning, precision, and perseverance. If you're thinking about taking on a similar project, I encourage you to do so. It's a great way to step away from the screen and create something tangible and long-lasting.
